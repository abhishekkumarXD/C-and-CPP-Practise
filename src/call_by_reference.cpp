//CALL BY REFERENCE 

//In call by reference, original value is modified because we pass reference(address).
//Here, address of the value is passed in the function, so actual and formal arguments shares the same address space.
//Hence, value inside the function, is reflected inside as well as outside the function.

//Note:  To understand the call by reference, we must have the basic knowledge of pointers.

//Here is an program using the concpt of call by reference.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
